Currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Fintech at Duke University, with a strong foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from Duke Kunshan University, I am eager to apply my technical skills and analytical mindset to support your data engineering initiatives.</p><p>In my previous roles—including internships at CITIC Securities, Google LLC, and CICC—I have honed my proficiency in Python and SQL, developed data pipelines, and performed data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. For example, at CITIC Securities, I built a Python-based data crawler to acquire company data and developed a chatbot for daily reporting, experiences that strengthened my understanding of ETL processes and data integration. Similarly, my role at Google LLC involved cleaning large datasets and constructing sub-tables for in-depth market analysis, further reinforcing my database management and analytical abilities.</p><p>Beyond my professional experiences, my academic projects have provided me with hands-on experience in data engineering and analytics. I have built backend APIs for financial data retrieval using Django and integrated data visualization tools in projects such as a business study for the NC Bankers Association. These projects not only deepened my technical expertise in data handling and reporting but also refined my ability to work collaboratively and communicate complex technical concepts effectively.</p><p>I am excited by the prospect of contributing to Hudson Advisors’ efforts in designing, maintaining, and optimizing data pipelines while learning from a team of experienced data engineers and analysts. I am confident that my background, technical proficiency, and proactive approach to problem-solving make me a strong candidate for this role.</p><p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can add value to your team.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Shun Guo (Sean)</p>',10)]))}const g=a(r,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
