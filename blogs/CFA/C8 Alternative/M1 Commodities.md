### Life cycle of commodities

* The commodity production life cycle reflects and amplifies the changes in storage, weather, and political/economic events that shift supply and demand.
* A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events. A long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react. 
* Agricultue and livestock have well-defined seasons and growth cycles that are specific to geographic regions. Energy and metals sectors are extracted all year around.

### Major participants 

* **Hedger** trade in the market to hedge their exposure related to the commodity
* **Speculator** have an information advantage and seek to outperform hedgers. They also provide liquidity and price discovery for the market in exchange for a profit
* **Arbitrageurs** attempts to capitalize on mispricing between comodity versus future price.
* **Exchanges** (Clearinghouses) set trading rules and provide trading infrastructure
* **Analyst** are non market participants who use the exchange information to perform research and conduct policy as well as to facilitate market participation
* **Regulators** monitor the market. 

### Key characteristics that differentiate commodity index

* The breadth of coverage (number of commodities and sectors)
* The relative weightings assigned to each commodity
* The rolling methodology for determing how these contracts are rolled over into future months
* The methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights
* The goverance of index

## Theories of future returns

**Spot and future pricing**

* Basis is the difference between spot and futures prices
* The calendar spread is the future price difference between the near-term and longer-term contract.
* **Backwardation** is the situation in which spot price exceeds the future price ($S>F$), or the near-term futures price is higher than the longer term futures price. The opposite case is **contango** ($S<F$).

**Settlement**

* Cash settlement enables higher involvement of speculators and arbitrageurs
* Physical settlement ensures a convergence of the futures and spot price, which may not occur in cash-settlement market. 
* Spot prices are highly localized and associated with physical delivery, limiting the ability to hedge and speculate.

### Insurance theory

Under the theory, only **backwardation** is possible

* A commodity producer is long the physical good (natural) and thus would short future contracts to hedge its sales price and make their revenues more predictable
* The future curve is in backwardation normally because producer persistently sell futures, pushing down futures prices 
* The future price has to be lowet than current spot price as a form of remuneration to speculators who takes on the price risk.

### Hedging pressure hypothesis

Both sides have position in market, so $S=F$ is the normal state. If seller side is stronger $S>F$, otherwise $S<F$

### Theory of storage

$$
\text{Future price}=\text{Spot price}+\text{Storage costs}-\text{Convenience yield}
$$



* Contago: Storage cost is higher than convenience yield
* Backwardation: Convenience yield is higher than storage

## Componenets of Future Returns

There are 3 part of futrue returns

* Price return

$$
\text{Price return}=\frac{\text{current}-\text{previous}}{\text{previous}}
$$

* Collateral return: return from cash used to maintain position (interest rate)

* Roll return: return generated by conrtract replacement 

$$
\text{Roll return}=\frac{\text{Near term closing price}-\text{Farther term future closing price} }{\text{Near term closing price}}\times \text{Percentage of position being rolled}
$$

>[!note]
>
>* Roll yield is generally positive in backwardation, but negative in contago
>* Roll return have an important impact on single period return but overall has minor impact compared with price return
>* Roll return can be less dependent by diversification
