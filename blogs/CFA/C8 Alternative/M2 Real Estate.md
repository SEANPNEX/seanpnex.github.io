# Real Estate 

## Classification

### Global INdustry Classfication Standard (GICS)

* Firms engaged in operation, developing, or servicing real estate investments
* Real estate investment trusts (REITs)

### Sensitivity To Business Cycle

* Defensive (e.g. health care REITs)
* Cyclical (e.g. industrial and office REITs)

### Statistical Factors

* Property classes: Ranking based on a combination of location, age, quality, income levels, and recent property appreciation

### Purpose of Use

* Commercial: Lease or rental (Residential or non-residential use)
* Residential 

## Investment Characteristics of Commercial Property

The root purpose is to earn **rental income**

* Residential Use
  * Include single-family detached house or multi-family properties
  * Tenants may enjoy protections as limits on rent increases or evictions and leases are usually for a much shorter term than for non-residential properties.
* Non-residential Use
  * More closely related to economic use
  * More attached to structrual volatility 
  * **Office**: lower development risk when built for the needs of key tenants (e.g. medical office) or major tenant commits to occupy a large portion of space. (*Decrease demand due to remote work*)
  * **Hospitality**: diverse by size, clientele, and available amenities.
    * Hotels for business travel are very **cyclical**
    * Hotels for tourists depend on the level of consumer confidence and siposable income
    * Destination resorts are luxurious and carry high fixed costs
  * **Industrial and warehouse**: designed for special industrial use and may be difficult to convert (Increasedemand due to e-commerce)
  * **Retail**: proximity to workers and residents affects occupancy, rents, and property prices (e.g. shopping malls, restaurants)
  * **Senior housing faciolities**: provide non-medical amenities (increase due to aging population)

### Cash flow analysis 

* Gross potential rental income (GPRI) assuming **full occupancy**:

$$
GPRI = \text{Market rent}\times \text{Rentable space}
$$

* Gross rental income (GRI)

$$
GRI = \text{Current rent}\times \text{Rentable spcae}
$$

* Loss to lease; $GPRI-GRI$
  * Positive: current lease to low
  * Negative: excess supply and possible failing lease rate.
* Effective gross rental income (effective GRI)

$$
\text{Effective GRI}=GRI+\text{other revenue}-\text{vacancy loss}
$$

* Net operating income (NOI)

$$
NOI = \text{Effective GRI}-\text{Operating expenses}-\text{Property maintenance allowance}
$$

## Benefit of Real Estate 

* Current income and Capital appreciation
  * Step-up clauses: pre-determined future rent rise
  * Indexed rents: change based on market variables
  * Overage rent clauses: higher rent if sales exceed the target
* Inflation hedge
* Diversification
* Tax benefit
  * Tax shield due to depreciation
  * REITs can effectively avoid double taxation

## Risk of Real Estate 

* Economic factors: Change in economic activity, demographics, relative supply, and the cost of capital
* Property management, obsolescence, technological change, zoning law, and environmental factors.

## Due Diligence 

* Market overview
* Current lease
* Future lease outlook
* Financial review
* Documentation re4view
* Property inspection and service agreement

## Valuation

### Direct Capitalization (GGM)

$$
\text{cap rate}=r-g\\
\text{value}= \frac{NOI}{\text{cap rate} }
$$

### DCF

$$
\text{value}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{NOI}{(1+r)^i}+\frac{\text{Terminal value}}{(1+r)^n}
$$

where terminal value can be obtained by GGM:
$$
\text{Terminal Value}=\frac{NOI_n(1+g)}{r-g}
$$

### Cost approach

Replacement cost: includes land acquisition, property construction cost, and developer's expected profit

Adjustment (down): deduct depreciation expense and consider age, location, or other factors that lower property value

### Sales Comparison approach

* Capture comparable properties' trading prices
* Adjust unit prices for differences
* Calculate the arithmetic mean of adjusted

## Real Estate Indexes

### Appraisal-based indexes

We calculate the Holding period return (HPR):
$$
HPR = \frac{NOI-\text{Capital expenditures}+(MV_{End}-MV_{begin})}{MV_{begin}}
$$

* Reason: Infrequent appraisals and difficult to capture changes of transaction prices timely
* Outcomes: **underestimated** volatility, correlation, and ovestated Sharpe ratio
* Adjustment: unsmooth or use transaction-based index

### Transaction-based indexes

* The combnination of actual transactions
* Repeat sales indexes: Rely on repeat sales of same property
* Hedonic indexes: User independent regression variables to reflect value

### Other indexes

* REITs indexes
* MBS indexes
* Covered bond indexes
