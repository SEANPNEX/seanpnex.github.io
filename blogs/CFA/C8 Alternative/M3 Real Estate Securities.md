## Valuation

### Net Asset Value

Market Value (MV) of equity: $\text{MV of asset}-\text{MV-liabilities}$, dividing by number of shares outstanding will get NAVPS (Net Value of Market Per Share). Compare with REITs will get the market situation.

Steps:

1. Values of property held by REITs and REOCs are estimated by capitalizing the NOI using capital rate: $P=\frac{NOI_1}{\text{r-g}}$, where the cap rate = $r-g$ can be referenced from similar properties in the market. 

> [!Note]
>
> NOI need to be annualized and time growth rate to get $NOI_1$

2. The book value of cash, AR, prepaid expense, land for future dev are added to obtain estimated **gross asset value**. Good will and DTA will be excluded
3. Debt and other liabilities are subtracted. DTL will be excluded.
4. Divide shares outstanding to get **NAVPS**

Considerations:

* Cap rate not accurate
* NAV reflects value to a private market buyer
* NAV implicitly treats REIT as a static pool of assets
* NAV estimates can become quite subjective when property market become illiquid and when REITs own many property. 

### Relative Value (Price Multiple)

P/FFO or P/AFFO are used in relative valuation

#### FFO

Funds From Operation(FFO) is generally calculated as NI + Losses from sales of properties - Gain from sales + Depreciation and amortization. 

#### AFFO

Based on FFO:

* Minus Non-cash rent adjustment from accounting
* Minus recurring maintenance capital expenditure and leasing commissions.

>AFFO is also known for funds available for distribution (**FAD**) or cash available for distribution (**CAD**).
