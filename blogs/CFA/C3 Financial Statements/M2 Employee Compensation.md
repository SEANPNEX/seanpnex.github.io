### Valuation considering

* Use diluted shares for outstanding but unvested share-based awards (SBA)
* Dilution from future SBA: Deduct share-based expense from FCFF (view as cash cost)



## Post-Empolyment Compensation 养老金


Fund Status = PA - PBO

### PPC Classification

Generally we consider negative fund status (PA < PBO)

Then we let Net_PBO + PBO - PA = Net_PBO + I-AG+S-AR-C = Net_PBO_End

Note I-AG+S-AR as Total periodic Pension Cost (TPPC)
